- `DESIGN_PLAN.md` from project root
- `.claude/state/session.json` for previous command status

**Implementation**: 
1. **STATE_MANAGER**: Update state - current_command="plan", current_step=1, step_name="load_project_manager"
2. Load STATE_MANAGER agent
3. Load PROJECT_MANAGER agent
4. Review DESIGN_PLAN.md for project context, technology stack, and requirements
5. Initialize planning session with project parameters
6. Validate design command completion

**Outputs**: 
- PROJECT_MANAGER agent loaded with project context

- State properly updated

### Step 2: Documentation Review
**Purpose**: Review internal and external documentation to establish context

**Inputs**: 
- docs/internal/ directory contents

**Implementation**: 
1. **STATE_MANAGER**: Update state - current_step=2, step_name="documentation_review"
2. **Internal Documentation**: 
   - Fully ingest all files in docs/internal/
   - Load existing_project.md if present (for existing projects)
3. **External Documentation**:

- Relevant external documentation cataloged
- Context base established for planning

### Step 3: Capability Analysis and MCP Integration
**Purpose**: Analyze required external tool capabilities and establish MCP connections

**Inputs**: 
- Technology stack from DESIGN_PLAN.md
- Project requirements and complexity

**Implementation**: 
1. **STATE_MANAGER**: Update state - current_step=3, step_name="capability_analysis_mcp"
2. Analyze required capabilities based on technology stack
3. Request capabilities: "Need: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, [others based on stack]"

- Project technology stack and architecture decisions

**Implementation**: 
1. **STATE_MANAGER**: Update state - current_step=4, step_name="create_planning_documents"
2. Check technical requirement levels from DESIGN_PLAN.md:
   - If Technical Research = MINIMAL: Create `.claude/planning/technical-requirements.md`
   - If System Architecture = MINIMAL: Create `.claude/planning/system-architecture.md`
   - If Market Research > NONE: Create `.claude/planning/competitive-analysis.md`
3. Use templates from `.claude/planning/templates/` if they exist
4. Skip document creation if all requirements at NONE/default levels
5. Generate only necessary documents based on actual requirements

**Outputs**: 
- `.claude/planning/technical-requirements.md` (if Technical Research = MINIMAL)
- `.claude/planning/system-architecture.md` (if System Architecture = MINIMAL)
- `.claude/planning/competitive-analysis.md` (if Market Research > NONE)

**Implementation**: 
1. **STATE_MANAGER**: Update state - current_step=6, step_name="prototype_decomposition"
2. Analyze project scope for logical prototype boundaries
3. Create 1 or more prototypes, each must be:
   - Independently testable and deployable
   - Provides tangible user value
   - Can function as standalone system
4. **Provide details of capabilities/features each Prototype will contain**:
   - List specific features and functionality
   - Define user-facing capabilities
   - Specify technical components
5. Ensure **combination of Prototypes fulfills complete project scope**
6. Apply "When in doubt, split" rule for simpler prototypes
7. Define prototype sequence and minimal dependencies

**Outputs**:

### Step 7: Kanban Planning Tasks Creation
**Purpose**: Create planning and prototype tasks in Kanban system for project tracking

**Inputs**:

- Project context from session state

**Implementation**: 
```javascript
const { createProject } = require('./tools/project-create');
const { createKanbanAPI } = require('../utils/kanban-api');
const path = require('path');

// Ensure project exists and get current project info
const projectName = path.basename(process.cwd());
console.log(`üìã Creating planning tasks for: ${projectName}`);

// Call unified project creation (should reuse existing project from /design)
const project = await createProject(projectName, `Planning phase for ${projectName}`, 'hybrid');

if (project) {
  console.log(`‚úÖ Project ready for planning tasks: ${project.id}`);
  
  // Create prototype tasks in Kanban
  const kanban = createKanbanAPI();
  const planningTasks = [];
  
  // Create a task for each prototype
  for (const prototype of prototypesList) {
    const task = await kanban.createTask(
      project.id,
      `Prototype: ${prototype.name}`,
      `${prototype.description}\n\nFeatures:\n${prototype.features.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}`,
      {
        status: 'todo',
        priority: 'high',
        command: 'plan',
        estimatedHours: prototype.estimatedHours || 8,
        metadata: { 
          type: 'prototype',
          prototype_name: prototype.name,
          feature_count: prototype.features.length
        }
      }
    );
    planningTasks.push(task);
  }
  
  // Create overall project planning task
  const overviewTask = await kanban.createTask(
    project.id,
    'Project Planning Complete',
    'All prototypes defined and ready for implementation',
    {
      status: 'in-progress',
      priority: 'high', 
      command: 'plan',
      metadata: { type: 'planning_overview' }
    }
  );
  
  console.log(`üìã Created ${planningTasks.length} prototype tasks + 1 planning overview task`);
  console.log(`üåê View progress at: http://localhost:3011`);
} else {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing with local planning only (no Kanban integration)`);
}
```
