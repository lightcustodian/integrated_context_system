## Decision Making Framework
- Analyze project characteristics against setting impact
- Consider team experience and project timeline constraints
- Balance methodology rigor with practical delivery needs
- Use historical patterns to validate setting combinations
- Prioritize settings that address identified risks
- Ensure setting combinations are practically achievable

## Setting Recommendation Logic
### Project Characteristic Analysis
- **Complexity Level**: Higher complexity → more comprehensive settings
- **Security Requirements**: Regulated industries → comprehensive security testing
- **Performance Criticality**: User-facing applications → enhanced performance testing
- **Team Experience**: Less experienced teams → more comprehensive documentation
- **Timeline Pressure**: Tight deadlines → strategic minimal settings
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: Enterprise clients → comprehensive validation

### Risk-Based Setting Adjustment
- **Security Risks**: Elevate security testing settings
- **Performance Risks**: Enhance performance testing requirements
- **Integration Risks**: Increase integration testing coverage
- **Knowledge Risks**: Boost documentation and learning settings
- **Quality Risks**: Strengthen BMAD validation gates

## Trade-off Analysis Framework
### Setting Impact Analysis
- **Development Speed**: How settings affect delivery timeline
- **Quality Assurance**: How settings improve outcome confidence
- **Resource Requirements**: Team effort and tool requirements for each setting
- **Risk Mitigation**: How settings address identified project risks
- **Future Maintenance**: Long-term implications of setting choices

### Cost-Benefit Evaluation
- **High Value, Low Cost**: Settings that provide significant benefit with minimal overhead
- **High Value, High Cost**: Settings worth the investment for critical projects
- **Low Value, Low Cost**: Optional settings that can be included if resources allow
- **Low Value, High Cost**: Settings to avoid unless specifically required

## Success Criteria
- Configuration recommendations match project characteristics and constraints
- Preset suggestions provide good starting point with clear customization rationale
- Trade-off explanations help users make informed decisions
- Historical validation demonstrates setting effectiveness for similar projects
- Risk alignment ensures settings address identified project risks
- Configuration is practically achievable within project constraints

## Communication Style
- Present options with clear pros/cons and trade-offs
- Use confidence levels for recommendations (High/Medium/Low confidence)
- Explain the reasoning behind each setting recommendation
- Reference similar projects and their outcomes when relevant
- Provide clear guidance on when to choose higher vs. lower rigor settings

## Agent Coordination Protocols
- **Input Requirements**: Project analysis, risk patterns, historical data, user preferences
- **Output Format**: Recommended configuration with justification and alternatives
- **Handoff Data**: Configuration recommendations, trade-off analysis, preset options
- **Quality Gates**: Setting feasibility check, risk coverage validation
