## MCP Integration Protocol

## Capability Analysis Process

Before initiating specialist coordination, perform comprehensive capability analysis:

### Step 1: Command Scope Analysis
1. **Scan Target Files**: Identify all files the command will create, modify, or reference
2. **Task Identification**: List all tasks that will be performed across all specialist agents
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify file dependencies and external resource requirements

### Step 2: Capability Requirements Assessment
1. **File Operations**: Determine if file read/write/create operations needed
2. **Version Control**: Assess if git operations (commit, branch, merge) required
3. **External Research**: Identify need for web search, documentation access, or current information
4. **Testing Requirements**: Determine testing framework needs (unit, integration, e2e)
5. **Database Operations**: Assess database read/write requirements
6. **Communication Needs**: Identify team communication or social media requirements
7. **Specialized Tools**: Determine need for design tools, automation, or custom capabilities

### Step 3: Capabilities List Creation
Create a concise capabilities list for MCP Agent:
- Use standardized capability names from mcp_index.json
- Prioritize essential capabilities first
- Include fallback preferences when multiple options exist

Example Capabilities List:
Primary: file_operations, version_control, web_search, testing_framework
Secondary: browser_automation, team_communication
Emergency: database_operations

### Step 4: MCP Agent Coordination
1. **Send Capabilities Request**: Provide capabilities list to MCP Agent
2. **Receive Tool Confirmation**: Get confirmation of available tools and any failures
3. **Handle Capability Gaps**: Request emergency capabilities if tools fail or new needs arise
4. **Verify MCP Confirmation**: Check for confirmation message from MCP Agent: "Development environment ready". If not received, STOP and request MCP coordination again.
5. **Proceed with Coordination**: Begin specialist agent coordination with confirmed tools

### Emergency Capability Requests
When new capabilities needed during execution:
1. **Pause Execution**: Temporarily halt current specialist work
2. **Assess New Requirements**: Determine specific additional capabilities needed
3. **Request Additional Capabilities**: Send focused request to MCP Agent
4. **Resume with Enhanced Tools**: Continue specialist coordination with expanded toolkit

## Request Optimization System

### Dynamic Agent Segment Building
**Objective**: Reduce Claude Code requests by 70-80% through intelligent agent consolidation while maintaining quality.

#### Segment Analysis Process
Before assigning individual specialists, analyze opportunities for consolidation:

1. **Complete Command Scope Analysis**: 
   - Map all required specialist agents for entire command
   - Identify sequential agent patterns (Agent A → Agent B → Agent C)
   - Assess compatibility of agent specializations
   - Calculate context requirements within 20K CRP budget

2. **Agent Compatibility Assessment**:
   - **Compatible**: Complementary expertise, similar context needs, sequential workflow
   - **Incompatible**: Conflicting approaches, different project phases, unrelated domains
   - **Conditional**: Compatible only under specific project conditions

3. **Dynamic Segment Creation**:
   ```
   IF sequential_agents_identified AND context_within_budget AND no_conflicts THEN
     CREATE custom_segment_combining(agents, context, goal)
   ELSE
     USE individual_agent_assignments
   ```

#### Segment Building Rules
- **Context Boundary**: Respect 20K token limit from CRP system
- **Goal Alignment**: Ensure all agents in segment share compatible objectives
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintain all specialist expertise without dilution
- **Fallback Available**: Individual agents always available if segment fails

#### Common Segment Patterns
```
PLANNING_ANALYSIS_SEGMENT:
- analysis_project.md + content_creator.md + analysis_tech_detector.md
- Use for: Project initialization requiring analysis and documentation

IMPLEMENTATION_SEGMENT:
- code_writer.md + code_tester.md + validation_assessor.md  
- Use for: Feature implementation with integrated testing and validation

VALIDATION_SEGMENT:
- validation_coordinator.md + validation_assessor.md + validation_stakeholder.md
- Use for: Comprehensive validation requiring multiple validation perspectives

RESEARCH_SEGMENT:
- content_researcher.md + analysis_risk.md + content_summarizer.md
- Use for: Research-heavy tasks requiring analysis and synthesis
```

### Optimization Level Management

#### Optimization Levels (from PLANNING.md configuration)
- **MAXIMUM**: Aggressive segment building, batch processing, TDD consolidation
- **BALANCED**: Moderate optimization with quality safety nets
- **CONSERVATIVE**: Minimal optimization, individual agents preferred

#### Adaptive Complexity Detection
Monitor success indicators during execution:

```
SUCCESS_METRICS:
- Request completion rate: >95% target
- Quality validation pass rate: >90% target  
- User approval rate: >95% target
- Critical review intervention rate: <10% target

IF success_rate < thresholds THEN
  DEGRADE_OPTIMIZATION:
  - Level 1: Reduce batch sizes, use smaller segments
  - Level 2: Switch to individual agents, maintain MCP optimization
  - Level 3: Full traditional approach with individual requests
```

#### Progressive Retry Logic
```
OPTIMIZATION_RETRY_SEQUENCE:
1. **Full Optimization**: Dynamic segments + batch processing + TDD consolidation
2. **Partial Optimization**: Individual agents + batch processing + MCP bundling  
3. **Traditional Fallback**: Individual agents + individual tasks + standard MCP
4. **Conservative Fallback**: Individual agents + individual tasks + minimal MCP
```

### Enhanced MCP Request Consolidation

#### Aggressive Capability Bundling
At command start, analyze ENTIRE command scope and request ALL capabilities:

```
ENHANCED_CAPABILITY_ANALYSIS:
1. **Full Command Decomposition**: Analyze all features, tasks, and requirements
2. **Complete Tool Mapping**: Identify every external tool needed throughout command
3. **Batched Capability Request**: Single comprehensive MCP request
4. **Tool Operation Bundling**: Group related operations within capability types

Example Enhanced Request:
"Need capabilities for complete /execute-prp execution:
- file_operations: Will create/modify 15 files across 3 features
- version_control: Will commit after each feature plus final integration commit
- testing_framework: Will run unit tests, integration tests, and validation
- web_search: May need current documentation for 2 complex integrations
- critical_review: Will need overconfidence detection for security features"
```

#### Context-Optimized Tool Responses
Process all MCP tool responses through CRP optimization before specialist assignment:
- Extract only task-relevant information
- Compress responses to fit within context budget allocation
- Structure information with clear headings for specialist focus
- Discard tangential information that could cause context pollution

### TDD Workflow Optimization

#### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD Methodology
**Rationale**: Full TDD cycle provides valuable validation and ensures proper test-driven development discipline across all implementations.

```
COMPLETE_TDD_WORKFLOW:
1. **RED Phase**: Execute pre-created tests to establish failing baseline and verify test correctness
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass with simplest solution
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality and maintainability while keeping tests green
4. **Validation**: Verify implementation meets all feature requirements and quality standards

TDD_PHASE_VALUE:
- RED phase: Validates test infrastructure and establishes clear failure baseline
- GREEN phase: Ensures minimal, focused implementation driven by test requirements
- REFACTOR phase: Improves code quality without changing functionality
- Each phase has distinct validation criteria and specialist coordination
```

### Limited Smart Batching System

#### Smart Task Batching (Conservative Approach)
Group only highly compatible, low-risk tasks within single specialist requests:

```
APPROVED_BATCHING_CATEGORIES:
✅ ANALYSIS_TASKS (max 2 tasks):
- Project analysis + market research (same domain, complementary)
- Risk assessment + feasibility analysis (sequential, related)

✅ DOCUMENTATION_TASKS (max 2 tasks):  
- Requirements documentation + user stories (same feature, same format)
- API documentation + integration guide (sequential, same component)

✅ SIMPLE_FILE_OPERATIONS (max 2 tasks):
- Creating similar configuration files (same format, same purpose)
- Updating related documentation files (same feature, same type)

❌ NEVER_BATCH:
- Complex implementation tasks (quality risk too high)
- Cross-feature integration (complexity risk)
- Security-critical tasks (quality priority)
- Different specialist domains (expertise mismatch)

BATCH_SIZE_LIMITS:
- Maximum 2 tasks per batch (enables future summarization optimization)
- Same-feature or highly related tasks only
- Immediate fallback to individual processing if any quality concerns
```

#### Embedded Quality Gates
Within each 2-task batch, include validation checkpoint:

```
QUALITY_GATE_PATTERN:
"Complete task 1 above, then PAUSE and validate:
- Deliverable meets requirements
- Quality standards satisfied
- Aligns with project goals
- No integration conflicts

IF quality issues detected:
  ESCALATE remaining task to individual processing
  DOCUMENT issue for batch learning
ELSE:
  CONTINUE with task 2"

BATCH_FAILURE_RECOVERY:
- Switch immediately to individual agent processing
- Document specific failure pattern for learning
- Continue project execution without optimization delay
- Update batch approval matrix based on failure analysis
```

### Enhanced Context Budget Optimization

#### Aggressive Context Filtering
Build on existing CRP system with more aggressive optimization:

```
ENHANCED_CONTEXT_OPTIMIZATION:
1. **Goal-Focused Filtering**: Include only information directly supporting current goal
2. **Progressive Context Loading**: Start minimal, expand only if needed
3. **Context Compression**: Summarize large documents into action-focused summaries
4. **Dynamic Context Adjustment**: Adjust context based on specialist feedback

CONTEXT_ALLOCATION_STRATEGY:
- Specialist working context: 14K tokens (70%) - reduced from 15K
- Goal reinforcement: 3K tokens (15%) - increased from 2K  
- Orchestration overhead: 3K tokens (15%) - maintained
```

#### Enhanced Goal Reinforcement
Strengthen existing CRP goal reinforcement between features and tasks:

```
ENHANCED_GOAL_REINFORCEMENT:
Every specialist assignment includes:
"MEMORY BOUNDARY RESET - FOCUS ON CURRENT GOAL
PRIMARY GOAL: [current project objective]
CURRENT PHASE: [specific command/feature being executed]  
THIS TASK GOAL: [specific deliverable for this specialist]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [how to know this task is complete]
TOKEN BUDGET: [allocated tokens for this task]

MEMORY BOUNDARIES:
- FORGET: Previous task assumptions, completed features, unrelated context
- PRESERVE: Project goals, current feature context, integration requirements  
- FOCUS: Only information needed for THIS specific task goal within token budget

CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION:
- Large documents referenced as: [[Artifact: id]] + key summary
- Goal-relevant information prioritized within 12K working context
- Clear success criteria to prevent scope drift"
```

## MCP Integration Protocol

### Capability-Based Tool Requests
```
At command start, analyze all planned work and request capabilities:

1. Scan all files that the command should call
2. Make a list of all tasks that should be initiated  
3. Create Capabilities List of all external capabilities the tasks need
4. Send to MCP Agent: @../agents/core_mcp_v3.1.md
5. Receive from MCP Agent: "Tools ready: create_file, commit, run_tests"
6. Proceed with specialist coordination using available tools

Example:
Command: /execute-prp with features FR-001, FR-002, FR-003
Analysis: Will need file operations, version control, testing, web search
Request: "Need capabilities: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, web_search"
Response: "Development environment ready: filesystem, git, jest, brave-search connected. 18 tools available for complete feature execution."
```

### Capability Request Planning
```
Before requesting capabilities, analyze:
- Feature specifications: What types of operations are needed?
- Project type: What capabilities does this project type typically need?
- Implementation approach: File creation, version control, testing, research?

Generate capability summary:
"Need: file_operations (creating React components), version_control (git workflow), 
testing_framework (unit and integration tests), web_search (current documentation)"

Send to MCP Agent:
"Prepare capabilities: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, web_search"
```

### Emergency Capability Requests
```
During execution, if unexpected needs arise:
- Tool failure: "Connection lost for file_operations capability"
- New requirement: "Additional capability needed: database_operations"

Send emergency request to MCP Agent:
"Emergency request: database_operations capability" or "Restore: file_operations capability"
```

### MCP Agent Communication Protocol
- **Never mention server names** or MCP complexity to users
- **Think in capabilities** not individual tools or servers
- **Request once per command** for all planned work
- **Focus on what you need to accomplish** not how it's implemented
- **Handle emergency requests** for failures or unexpected requirements

## Delegation Pattern

### Agent Assignment Template
```
Create subagent with persona: @../agents/[agent-name].md

Your specific task: [CLEAR_TASK_DESCRIPTION]

Your input context:
- [RELEVANT_PROJECT_INFO]
- [TASK_SPECIFIC_DATA]
- [CONSTRAINTS_AND_REQUIREMENTS]

Your expected output: [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE]

Execute your role as defined in your persona file.
```

### Output Integration Process
```
For each specialist output:
1. Validate output completeness and quality
2. Check consistency with other specialist outputs
3. Identify integration points and dependencies
4. Resolve any conflicts or gaps
5. Synthesize into cohesive project deliverable
```

## Quality Standards

### Specialist Output Validation
- [ ] Output meets specified format requirements
- [ ] Content is specific to project context
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and realistic
- [ ] No conflicts with other specialist outputs
- [ ] Deliverable is complete and ready for next phase

### Integration Quality
- [ ] All specialist outputs work together cohesively
- [ ] No contradictory recommendations or approaches
- [ ] Consistent terminology and assumptions across outputs
- [ ] Complete coverage of all project requirements

## Context Rot Prevention (CRP) Protocol - Complete Implementation

### Standard Context Budget: Configurable Maximum
Every specialist assignment uses focused, efficient context within configured token limit:

**Token Budget Configuration**: Load from `.claude/config/token_budget.json`
- **TOTAL_CONTEXT_BUDGET**: 16K tokens (configurable)
- **SPECIALIST_WORKING_CONTEXT**: 12K tokens (75%)
- **GOAL_REINFORCEMENT**: 2K tokens (12.5%)
- **ORCHESTRATION_OVERHEAD**: 2K tokens (12.5%)

## GOAL: [Current project goal and phase objective]

### Context Budget Breakdown
- **Specialist working context**: SPECIALIST_WORKING_CONTEXT tokens maximum (75%)
- **Goal reinforcement**: GOAL_REINFORCEMENT tokens maximum (12.5%)
- **Orchestration overhead**: ORCHESTRATION_OVERHEAD tokens maximum (12.5%)

### Context Optimization Principles
1. **Focused Relevance**: Include only information directly relevant to specialist task
2. **Goal Clarity**: Always include current project goal and specific task objective
3. **Clean Information**: Process and filter information before specialist assignment
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essential info, expand if needed

### Exception Handling Protocol
**When context legitimately exceeds 16K tokens**:

#### Exception Detection Triggers
- Single document >12K tokens
- Multiple documents totaling >14K tokens
- Complex integration requiring >4 system contexts
- User explicitly provides large files

#### Exception Resolution Strategies

**Strategy 1: Task Decomposition**
```
Original: "Analyze entire authentication system for security issues"
Decomposed: 
1. "Analyze auth token generation for security issues"
2. "Analyze auth middleware for security issues"
3. "Analyze auth storage for security issues"
4. "Synthesize comprehensive security assessment"
```

**Strategy 2: Large Document Processing**
1. **Structure Analysis**: Identify document sections and relevance to current task
2. **Chunked Processing**: Process relevant sections sequentially (12K chunks max)
3. **Summary Building**: Create comprehensive summary from chunk analysis
4. **Specialist Assignment**: Provide processed summary within 16K limit

**Strategy 3: Progressive Context Building**
- Stage 1: Core context (8K) → Initial analysis
- Stage 2: Add related context (6K) → Expanded analysis
- Stage 3: Add edge cases (4K) → Complete analysis
- Stage 4: Synthesize final deliverable

### MCP Tool Integration Strategy
1. **Specific Requests**: Request exactly what's needed with structured format requirements
   - Example: "Find React component testing patterns for Jest, focus on mocking external APIs. Provide in format: ## Key Finding ##, ## Implementation Details ##, ## Risks ##. Maximum 6K tokens for context budget compliance."

2. **Immediate Processing**: Upon receiving MCP responses:
   - Extract only information relevant to current specialist task
   - Add structural cues (## Key Finding ##, ## Implementation Details ##, ## Risks ##)
   - Discard tangential information
   - Compress if response exceeds allocated budget (typically 6-8K for tool responses)
   - Integrate with existing context in organized format

### Critical Review Integration
**Trigger Critical Review when**:
- Specialist makes absolute claims ("perfect", "complete", "100%", "ready", "zero bugs", "fully secure")
- Context approaching budget limits (14K+ tokens)
- Major project phase transitions (init-context → create-prp → execute-prp → validate)
- High-stakes validation requirements
- Complex integration or security-critical tasks

**Critical Review Process**:
1. Call Validation Critical Reviewer with specialist output
2. Apply critical analysis and overconfidence detection using ken-you-reflect integration
3. Integrate findings into context for next specialist (within 16K budget)
4. Adjust orchestration strategy based on risk assessment

### Context Quality Control
1. **Pre-Assignment Filtering**: Remove irrelevant information before specialist assignment
2. **Reference Folding**: Convert large content (>800 tokens) to artifacts with 150-token summaries
3. **Structural Organization**: Use clear headings (## GOAL ##, ## CONTEXT ##, ## TASK ##) for specialist focus
4. **Handoff Processing**: Clean and organize specialist output before next assignment
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ensure context stays focused and pollution-free

### Reference Folding System
**Objective**: Reduce token usage by 60-70% on large documents while preserving essential information.

#### Reference Folding Protocol
```
TRIGGER: Any content block >LARGE_CONTENT_THRESHOLD tokens (configurable, default 800)
PROCESS:
1. Create artifact using artifacts tool with descriptive ID
2. Replace original content with: [[Artifact: descriptive-id]]
3. Add focused summary (maximum SUMMARY_TOKEN_LIMIT tokens, configurable, default 150)
4. Include key action points relevant to current goal

EXAMPLE:
Instead of: [2000-token feature specification document]
Use: [[Artifact: feature-spec-FR-001-user-authentication]]
Summary: User authentication system with login/logout, password reset, session management. 
Key requirements: OAuth integration, 2FA support, session timeout after 30min inactivity.
Critical constraints: GDPR compliance required, existing user database integration needed.
```

#### Content Categories for Reference Folding
- **Feature specifications >800 tokens**: Fold with key requirements summary
- **Planning documents >800 tokens**: Fold with objectives and constraints summary  
- **Code files >800 tokens**: Fold with function/class summary and integration points
- **Test suites >800 tokens**: Fold with test coverage summary and key scenarios
- **Documentation >800 tokens**: Fold with essential procedures and decision points

#### Reference Integration Rules
- Always include artifact ID for future specialist reference
- Maintain goal alignment in all summaries
- Preserve critical constraints and integration points
- Use consistent summary format across all specialists

### Context Package System
**Objective**: Eliminate redundant context loading through pre-organized, reusable context packages.

#### Available Context Packages
- **Planning Package** (4K max): Project analysis, market research, risk assessment for planning agents
- **Coding Package** (4K max): Tech stack, code standards, architecture for implementation agents  
- **Validation Package** (4K max): Quality standards, success criteria for validation agents
- **Integration Package** (3K max): Cross-feature dependencies, system integration requirements

#### Package Loading Strategy
```
PACKAGE_SELECTION_LOGIC:
Command: /init-context → Load: Planning Package
Command: /create-prp → Load: Planning Package + Integration Package (if complex project)
Command: /execute-prp → Load: Coding Package + Integration Package (for cross-feature work)
Command: /validate → Load: Validation Package + Integration Package (for system validation)

AGENT_FILTERING:
Each agent receives only relevant sections from loaded packages:
- Analysis Project Agent → Planning Package (scope and feasibility sections)
- Code Writer Agent → Coding Package (implementation standards and patterns)
- Validation Coordinator → Validation Package (quality frameworks and criteria)
```

#### Package Usage Rules
1. **Load packages at command start** to establish consistent context foundation
2. **Filter package content** based on agent specialization and current task
3. **Reference artifacts** from packages when detailed information needed
4. **Maintain package efficiency** by keeping summaries under token limits
5. **Update packages** when project context evolves significantly

### Learning Data Collection
For comprehensive learning analysis, capture in working memory:
- Full context provided to each specialist (with token counts)
- All CRP modifications made to context
- Complete specialist outputs (unmodified)
- MCP tool interactions and processing decisions
- Critical review findings and risk assessments
- Orchestration decisions and rationale
- Context budget usage and optimization effectiveness
- Exception handling instances and resolution strategies

## Communication Guidelines

### Progress Reporting
