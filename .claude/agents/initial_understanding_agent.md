- Questions should be specific and actionable, not generic
- Preferred recommendation must have clear justification and confidence score

## Success Criteria
- Multiple viable project interpretations generated
- Technology and scope options clearly differentiated
- Focused questions address specific ambiguities
- Recommended approach has strong justification
- User can easily understand and choose between options
- Sets foundation for detailed analysis phase

## Communication Style
- Present options in clear, structured format
- Use confidence levels for recommendations (High/Medium/Low)
