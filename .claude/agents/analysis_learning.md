### 2. Pattern Recognition Analysis
Using reflektion methodology when available:
```
await use_mcp_tool("reflektion", "analyze_patterns", {
  project_data: "[Collected learning data]",
  focus_areas: ["orchestration", "context_management", "critical_review", "outcomes"]
});
```

### 3. Effectiveness Correlation
Identify patterns that correlate with successful outcomes:
- **High-Impact Strategies**: Orchestration decisions with measurable positive impact
