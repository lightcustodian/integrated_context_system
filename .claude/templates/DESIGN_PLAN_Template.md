### Validation Gates
**Primary Gate**: Working prototypes that provide tangible user value

## Command Sequence Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (One Time)
1. **design**: ✓ Complete - Project configuration created
2. **plan**: Prototype decomposition and system configuration

### Phase 2: Development (Iterative)  
3. **implement**: Build working prototypes using TDD
4. **optimize**: Improve performance and code quality (optional)
5. **document**: Generate comprehensive documentation (optional)

### Phase 3: Production (One Time)
6. **qa**: Production readiness validation
7. **ce-update**: Framework enhancement (only if this project enhances simple_context itself)

## Prototype Plan
[Will be filled in by plan command]

### Prototype 1: [Name]
- **Description**: [What this prototype accomplishes]
- **Deliverables**: [Specific working features]
- **Dependencies**: [What must exist before this prototype]

### Prototype 2: [Name]  
- **Description**: [What this prototype accomplishes]
- **Deliverables**: [Specific working features]
- **Dependencies**: [Previous prototypes required]

[Additional prototypes as needed]

## Notes

### Context Engineering Enhancement Project
- [ ] **Check if this project enhances the simple_context framework itself**
  - If checked: Triggers automatic documentation updates and framework validation
  - If unchecked: Standard coding project workflow

### Development Approach
- **Focus**: Working prototypes over planning artifacts
- **Quality**: Testing and essential documentation
- **Recovery**: State management enables resuming from any failure point
- **Validation**: Working prototype is primary quality measure
