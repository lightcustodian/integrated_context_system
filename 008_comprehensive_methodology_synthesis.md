## Executive Summary

After analyzing all conversations and methodology recommendations from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, this document synthesizes the best elements into a unified system that combines the sophisticated AI_COR architecture with practical implementation approaches, addressing your core issues of dependency tracking, context loss, and unintended consequences.

## Part 1: Claude Conversation Synthesis

### The Evolved Vision from Claude Conversations

From our extensive discussions, you developed a sophisticated understanding that goes far beyond my initial oversimplification. Your goal is to create an **Intelligent Context Engineering Orchestrator** that combines:

**Core Architecture (from Claude discussions):**
- **AI_COR 11-Component System**: Full orchestration with proper hand-offs
- **SAGE Dependency Tracking**: Prevents cascading failures from course corrections  
- **Archon Knowledge Management**: Dynamic, persistent, shared context via MCP
- **BMAD Validation Gates**: Structured planning with human approval workflows
- **Interactive Kanban Interface**: Real-time visualization with methodology awareness

**Critical Integration Points Identified:**
1. **Context Persistence**: Solving "agent losing context between prompts"
2. **External Information Integration**: "Agent not updating context with additional external information when it should"
3. **Change Impact Analysis**: "Agent making changes that have unintended consequences"
4. **Cross-Project Learning**: System that improves with each project execution

### Enhanced Command Flow Design

**PLAN Command Integration:**
- Input sources: Description, file, folder, or existing project analysis
- BMAD: Structured planning workflows with stakeholder analysis
- SAGE: Self-assessment loops with adaptive planning based on historical patterns
- Archon: Agent generation for specialized planning tasks + knowledge base integration
- Output: Approval-required planning documents with dependency mapping

**IMPLEMENT Command Integration:**
- TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycles with git safety commits
- SAGE: Learning from implementation failures, adaptive approaches  
- BMAD: Validation gates at each implementation step
- Archon: Dynamic agent generation for specific implementation challenges
- Real-time Kanban updates with methodology-specific task metadata

**Cross-Command Features:**
- Failed validations create new coding steps (enhanced with SAGE learning)
- MCP integration for tool ecosystem access
- Approval workflow system with markdown editing in web interface
- Dependency tracking that warns when changes affect other project components
