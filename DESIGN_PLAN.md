## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: LocalStorage limitations (5MB max)
- **Mitigation**: Implement storage quota monitoring and cleanup suggestions
- **Contingency**: Offer export functionality for large datasets

**Risk**: Browser compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Feature detection and progressive enhancement
- **Contingency**: Fallback implementations for unsupported features

**Risk**: Mobile touch interactions
- **Mitigation**: Touch-friendly UI design with adequate touch targets
- **Contingency**: Alternative input methods for complex gestures

**Risk**: Data loss prevention
