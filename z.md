  1. Component Consolidation Strategy: I am not sure sure which of these methods are going to produce the best result. Some of the systems were concerned with the complexity. Multiple agents is not the type of complexity that concerns me. What do you think is best?
  2. Complexity Scaling Implementation: I want a minimum of a Plan and Implement commands with Optimize and QA optional. In our original system we had 6 planning documents that individually could be set NONE/MINIMAL/STANDARD/COMPREHENSIVE. The default was to set the 2 most important to Minimal and the other to None. I believe this type of methodology would work well. Please review that system in our .claude\templates\DESIGN_PLAN_Template.md document.
	  1. Example: Security Testing, Performance Testing, Integration Testing, Documentation could all have the same options. These could be set in the Design command.
	  2. Based on the systems that we are integrating, there are probably a dozen other parameters that could be set similarly.
	  3. I want these to be configurable by the user. 
	  4. I would really like to see these as settings with approval options in the web interface instead of how we do them now. They should be color-coded so it is easy for the use to see what he need to approve. There should be an easily accessible drop-down menu to set them. I would like to have an "Approve All" button.
  3. JSON Storage vs Database Priority: 
	  1. prioritize JSON file storage initially and plan database migration later
	  2. JSON should be stored in the docker system. That way the learning is automatically shared.
  4. SAGE Dependency Tracking Granularity: 
	  1. I am more interested in its adaptability than the actual dependency tracking. What I mean is that it is incredibly difficult to map out all of the ways that a systems components depend on each other. I want basic dependency mapping, but I want the system to adapt to change. Any time the plan or an item in the plan is changed the system should automatically review itself, not just what it is going to do, but what it has already done to determine if that change will affect another component. Then it should create tasks to remedy any issues found.
	  2. Yes, it should integrate with git, but I don't know how effective you are with git. 
	  3. Create tasks and fix the issues.
  5. MCP Integration Scope: 
	  1. I think enhancing our system is best. What do you think?
	  2. Make this a configurable setting similar to what I discussed with Complexity Scaling above.
	  3. Make it project-specific by default. Create an approval task for each documentation type gathered. The user can specific that it globally shared. This should copy the data to the docker system. 
	  4. Understand that docker content can be accessed by ../docker
  6. Approval Workflow Specifics:
	  1. Plan: We currently have 2 approvals in the plan phase. I would like to retain these, but they will probably look different based on the 3 new systems that we are integrating.
		  1. Understanding/Improvement: verify AI's understands of our goals, answer AI's questions, review AI's recommended improvements
		  2. Plan/design: All the info that goes into these two steps
		  3. The planning docs that have NONE/MINIMAL/STANDARD/COMPREHENSIVE options should not have a reject option.
		  4. The .md files should have Approve/Reject.
			  1. Reject: Means review the questions in the document and try again.
	  2. Implement: We previously broke Implementation into multiple Prototypes. Each had its own approval. This means that on a complex project we would run /implement multiple times. The approval is the users way of saying "I have tested the prototype and it passed."
		  1. These should have Approve/Reject
			  1. Reject should provide a comments section where the user can explain why they are rejecting.
	  3. No, delegation at this time
  7. Real-time Integration Priorities
	  1. real-time task updates or real-time approval workflow updates: Both
	  2. Everything will run on the local system.
	  3. The CLI should drive the web app. The only way that I can see this happening is if the user makes a change on the web app while the CLI is making a change. I am not sure. What changes are you concerned with?
  8. Learning System Activation:
	  1. Passive vs Active Learning: What are the pros and cons of each? What do you recommend? Why?
	  2. Suggestions vs Adaptations: This system is run by you. Which will be most effective with you?
	  3. Project-specific learning should just affect the project and not be retained in the system.
9. Provide your response in [auto-increment starting at the last unused # using the format XXX]_[task_name].md
