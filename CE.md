# Simple Context Engineering System

## Overview

The Simple Context Engineering System (`simple_context`) is a streamlined development framework designed to deliver working prototypes quickly for coding projects. It eliminates the complexity that reduces quality and consistency while maintaining the powerful MCP tool integration and essential quality standards.

## Core Philosophy

### Results Over Process
- **Prototype = Phase**: Each prototype is a complete, usable, deployable deliverable
- **Working Code First**: Focus on functional deliverables, not planning artifacts  
- **Quality through Testing**: Maintain quality via testing, not extensive process overhead

### Simplicity Principles
- **4-Agent Workflow**: PROJECT_MANAGER, CODER, TESTER, REVIEWER
- **Direct Handoffs**: Simple agent coordination
- **Essential Documentation**: Enough for next Claude Code instance to understand and build upon

## System Architecture

### File Organization
```
Root/
├── CLAUDE.md (agent instructions)
├── CE.md (this system explanation)  
├── DESIGN_PLAN.md (created by design command)
└── .claude/
    ├── commands/ (7 command files)
    ├── agents/ (4 active agents + preserved existing agents)
    ├── state/ (session.json for state tracking)
    └── utils/ (minimal Python utilities)
```

### 4-Agent System
1. **PROJECT_MANAGER**: State management, MCP integration, simple coordination
2. **CODER**: Writing code, following patterns, implementing features (reused existing)
3. **TESTER**: Running tests, validation, debugging (reused existing) 
4. **REVIEWER**: Quality checks, critical review (reused existing, used only in QA command)

*Note: All existing agents preserved for future use, but only 4 used in standard workflow*

## Command System

### 7-Command Workflow

#### 1. Design (One Time: Beginning)
- **Purpose**: Create project understanding and basic configuration
- **Process**: Requirements analysis → DESIGN_PLAN.md creation → System configuration
- **Key Features**: 
  - Supports `--file` flag for analyzing existing requirements
  - Default technical requirements (Market Research: NONE, Technical Research: MINIMAL, Risk Management: NONE, System Architecture: MINIMAL)
  - Focus on coding deliverables

#### 2. Plan (One Time: Beginning) 
- **Purpose**: Break project into usable prototypes and configure system
- **Process**: Load PROJECT_MANAGER → MCP setup → Prototype decomposition → User approval
- **Key Features**:
  - Prototype-based planning (each prototype is deployable)
  - MCP capability-based tool integration
  - State management initialization

#### 3. Implement (Iterative)
- **Purpose**: Build working prototypes using TDD methodology
- **Process**: Load agents → MCP integration → Feature analysis → TDD coding loop → Validation → Documentation → Approval
- **Key Features**:
  - Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycles
  - Per-feature task lists and testing
  - Working prototype validation gate
  - Basic user documentation

#### 4. Optimize (Iterative) 
- **Purpose**: Improve performance, code quality, and architecture
- **Process**: Performance analysis → Code quality improvement → Architecture refinement → Resource optimization → UX enhancement → Validation
- **Key Features**:
  - Performance benchmarking and optimization
  - Code refactoring while maintaining tests
  - Scalability and maintainability improvements

#### 5. Document (Iterative)
- **Purpose**: Generate comprehensive documentation
- **Process**: User docs → Technical docs → Installation guides → Troubleshooting → Maintenance docs → Review
- **Key Features**:
  - Documentation standard: Enable new Claude Code instance to understand and build upon work
  - User and technical documentation
  - Installation and troubleshooting guides

#### 6. QA (One Time: End)
- **Purpose**: Production readiness validation  
- **Process**: Security audit → Performance validation → Integration testing → Coverage analysis → Documentation review → Deployment readiness → Final approval
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive security and performance validation
  - Integration testing across all prototypes
  - Production readiness assessment

#### 7. CE-Update (One Time: End)
- **Purpose**: Update simple_context system itself (for framework enhancement projects)
- **Process**: Detect changes → Update documentation → Version control → Validate integrity → Update templates → Framework approval
- **Key Features**:
  - Only used when project enhances the framework itself
  - Automatic documentation updates
  - Framework integrity validation

## State Management

### Multi-Level State Tracking
```json
{
  "current_command": "implement",
  "current_step": 4,
  "step_name": "coding_loop", 
  "current_prototype": "P2-email-management",
  "current_feature": "F1-template-engine",
  "current_task": "T2-variable-substitution",
  "last_updated": "2025-08-05T19:30:00Z",
  "completed_prototypes": ["P1-deployment"],
  "next_prototype": "P3-lead-nurturing"
}
```

**Tracking Levels**:
- **Command Level**: Which command is executing
- **Step Level**: Which step within command (essential for failure recovery)
- **Prototype Level**: Which prototype is being worked on  
- **Feature Level**: Which feature within prototype
- **Task Level**: Which specific coding task (essential for development tracking)

**Recovery Capability**: System can resume from any failure point with complete context

## MCP Integration

### Capability-Based Tool Access
**Request Pattern**: `"Need: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, [specific tools]"`

**Common Tool Sets**:
- **Web Projects**: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, web_framework, database
- **API Projects**: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, database, api_tools  
- **Scripts**: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework
- **Desktop Apps**: file_operations, version_control, testing_framework, ui_framework

**Benefits**: 
- Powerful external tool access maintained
- Simple coordination without complex orchestration
- Graceful fallbacks for tool failures

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Implement/Optimize Commands**: Focus on working functionality
- **QA Command**: Appropriate test coverage for production readiness
- **TDD Methodology**: Red-Green-Refactor cycles for all features
- **Validation Gate**: Working prototype (primary quality measure)

### Documentation Standards
- **Core Principle**: Enable new Claude Code instance to understand what was built and build upon it
- **Levels**: Basic (implement) → Comprehensive (document command)
- **Focus**: Functional documentation, not process artifacts

### Technical Requirements Defaults
- **Market Research**: NONE (coding projects don't need market analysis)
- **Technical Research**: MINIMAL (basic research when needed)
- **Risk Management**: NONE (keep complexity low)
- **System Architecture**: MINIMAL (basic architecture documentation)

*User can manually adjust these for specific project needs*

## Error Handling

### 3-Attempt Recovery Pattern
1. **Attempt 1**: Try different approach
2. **Attempt 2**: Research solution using web_search capability  
3. **Attempt 3**: Simplify requirements or break into smaller tasks
4. **Escalation**: Present to human with specific context and recommendations

### State Recovery
- Complete state context maintained at all levels
- System can resume from any interruption point
- Rollback capability for each tracking level
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance

## Approval File System

### Human Review Protocol
- Every command generates `response_[date]_[time]_[command_name].md`
- Human provides explicit approval before command completion
- Approval files serve as audit trail and decision documentation
- Commands wait for explicit approval before proceeding

### Approval File Format
```markdown
# [Command Name] Approval - [Date] [Time]

## Progress Summary
[What was accomplished in this command]

## Deliverables
[Working prototypes or enhancements created]

## Testing Results
[Test coverage and validation outcomes]  

## Next Steps

## Issues/Risks
[Any problems identified or remaining risks]

## Human Approval Required
